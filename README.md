GroupText
=========
GroupText is a privacy-preserving group SMS platform originally developed for [GCSE Success](http://gcsesuccess.wordpress.com/). It designed with safeguarding in mind, allowing tutors to contact students without having access to their phone numbers and making messages visible to all other tutors for transparency.

It is built with [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/), [Meteor Router](https://github.com/tmeasday/meteor-router), [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and uses the [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/) platform.
