GroupText
=========
GroupText is a privacy-preserving group SMS platform, useful in scenarios where safeguarding is a concern. It allows tutors to contact students without having their phone numbers, and for transparency all messages are visible to all other tutors.

It is built with [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/), [Meteor Router](https://github.com/tmeasday/meteor-router), [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and uses the [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/) platform.
